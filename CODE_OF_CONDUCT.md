# Code of Conduct

## Overview

Our collective goal is to create a welcoming and secure environment for all group members and collaborators. Creating such an environment will foster creativity and collaboration that will help us create a well thought out project and efficiently use our time. We will also be able to make effective use of everyone's skills as a result of this.
## Statement on Diversity and Inclusivity

Diversity is a quality that is sought after in all group work because it encourages different ways of thinking and lets people come up with new ways to solve problems. Gender, race, age, and upbringing all influence how people think and contribute to diversity. Each member has the ability to challenge everyone's thinking and offer a fresh point of view to the group. Diversity and inclusion go hand in hand, and for a group to fully benefit from a diverse team, members must be inclusive. When a group is inclusive, all members, regardless of who they are, are treated with equality and respect, and they are given the chance to contribute to the group. It is essential that members maintain inclusiveness and respect this group's diversity.
